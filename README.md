# Reinforcement Learning for the Sanke game
--- 
###### RL AI algorithm development for the well known snake game that gets longer as it eats and the game ends as it bites itself.
#
Implementation of Q learning algorithm, used a neural network for the prediction of action given the current state. 

Contents:
* SnakeGame.py contains python class of the RL enviroment code of the game
* AItrainer.py script has the implementation of the Q learning and makes use SnakeGame class for environment
* AIgame.py script makes AI play the game and saves the video in the root folder with the name AIgraphicgame.mp4
